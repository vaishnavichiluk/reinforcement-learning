CartPole with Double Q-Learning &amp; NADT  Implemented a CartPole balancing agent using Double Q-Learning to reduce overestimation and Neural Adaptive Discretization Technique (NADT) for adaptive state space discretization. Aimed at improving learning stability and efficiency in reinforcement learning environments.


This project implements a reinforcement learning agent to balance the CartPole using Double Q-Learning and Neural Adaptive Discretization Technique (NADT).
Double Q-Learning helps reduce overestimation bias in Q-values, leading to more stable learning.
NADT adaptively discretizes the continuous state space, enabling better generalization and efficiency.
The combination of these techniques improves policy performance and convergence speed, making it a robust approach for solving control problems like CartPole.
